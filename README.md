# Dangers of excessive consumer price inflation, deflation and major asset price inflation
An analysis of the severe risks posed by price instability and asset bubbles:
- **Inflation Risks:** How high inflation acts as an unavoidable tax on savings, impacting retirees and low-income earners (e.g., Argentina's >100% inflation, Germany's 1923 hyperinflation).
